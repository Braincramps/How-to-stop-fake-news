# How-to-stop-fake-news

Proposed method on how to obtain news that is most truthful, but also has perspective since each person's reality is different.

The system would allow anyone to be a news maker and earn money by selling their information… 


• Known downside to system:
People selling news have to keep a reputation score and give up their identity.
	• This means they are willing to be known and not be anonymous
	• It also means they are willing to be scored on their reliability
	
• Identity:
There are already systems that will verify who you are and then provide you ways to prove your personage via encrypted verifiable signature.  Systems such as Civic.com.  It is important to know that the person is who they say they are.

 
• Reputation:
A Reporter needs to establish a reputation score.  This can be initially sent by including known reputation systems such as ebay, LinkedIn, Github, etc.
Once it is established it will then vary based on the score they receive from their reporting.

• Scoring to Present News:
They need to possess some amount of the three items below, which will be multiplied to derive the best producer.

1. knowledge of the event (Involvement, Expertise)
2. A valued reputation
3. Proximity 

Best News = (Knowledge + Reputation + Proximity)
BN=(50%*K + 40%*R + 10%*P)  ?? TBD

Knowledge, Reputation and Proximity would each be rated by the reporter on a 1 to 10 scoring system based on the above formulation. Thus if the person was very reliable, but didn't have much expertise they might not win the chance to report.  

They will be held to account on not being honest in their self-evaluation of these three metrics by the reading public.  There has to be a penalty to any type of falsifying their metrics.

• News Report Out:
The top three scores would write up their story and be included in the news event, which would be in a Wiki style environment so that it can link itself to stories that are intertwined.  This would  allow perspective based on cognitive background, biases and other environmental factors.  It would also allow people to follow links to other information that is pertinent to the story.

• Pay out:
The top three reporters would be paid bitcoin through a fund that is set up by people reading the news.  Perhaps people pay 100 satoshis for each article they wish to read and these funds go into the pool to pay news reporters.  

The system should be a non-profit, where excess funds to go help educate the people who wish to report.  That education would be in terms of writing skills and other essentials to being a valued reporter.

• Reader Rating System: (*still trying to think through this one)
Readers of the news will rate each writer on several items
1. Readability ??
2. Accuracy of facts ??
3. Knowledge of periphery ??

Accuracy can only be downgraded if you have an expertise rating and reputational score that is higher than the writer

Perhaps the top 10 writes of each article should rate each other, which will provide good feedback and a better rating system.
